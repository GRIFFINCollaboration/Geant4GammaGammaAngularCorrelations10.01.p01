Gamma-ray multipolarity input for gamma-gamma correlation simulations
-Evan Rand, July 2014

Each line contains 5 columns:

1) Energy of the starting nuclear level (keV)
   ********************************************************
   *** Identical to column 1 of PhotonEvaporation input ***
   *** See PhotonEvaporation-readme 			***
   ********************************************************	

2) Energy of the transition (keV)
   This is the energy difference between the initial and the final level.
   ********************************************************
   *** Identical to column 2 of PhotonEvaporation input ***
   *** See PhotonEvaporation-readme 			***
   ********************************************************

3) L1 Multipolarity.
   This is the multipolarity of the gamma for pure (and mixed) transitions. For a pure E2 transition, input 2 into this column. 
   For a pure M3 transition, input 3 into this column. If the transition is mixed, eg. M1+E2, input 1 into this column and 2 into the next column.

4) L2 Multipolarity.
   This is the multipolarity of the gamma for mixed transitions. This column is used only for mixed transitions, eg. M1+E2. 
   Input larger multipolarity into this column, eg. for M1+E2 transitions this column is 2.

5) Mixing Ratio
   Delta is this mixing ratio for mixed transitions. For pure transitions this column is 0. 
   Delta is defined as delta = <L2/L1>
